The dataset containing the records of both current and former employees is available to us. Compute the previous employee's total years of employment, years at the current firm, performance grade, number of promotions, hike percentage and salary.so that we can identify the contributing elements to resignation. Using that analysis, we may make predictions about which employee will resign next by comparing with the current staff.
